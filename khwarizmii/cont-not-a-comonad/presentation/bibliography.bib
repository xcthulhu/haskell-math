  abstract = {This short article presents an algorithm for bracket abstraction [1] which avoids a combinatorial explosion in the size of the resulting expression when applied repeatedly for abstraction in a series of variables. It differs from a previous solution [2] in introducing only a finite number of additional combinators and in not requiring that all the variables to be abstracted be treated together in a single operation.},

Other directions that such research might take are considered.},
